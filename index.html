            login and server navigation, and it has also helped to reduce the server load that previously caused
            frequent crashes and delays in online meetings.

            content, including adding my own graphics and sections. This project allowed me to demonstrate my ability to

            I developed a movie ticket booking system using Python as a school project for my XII grade. The system is
            modular and includes features such as the ability to release movies from an admin account, as well as the
            ability for customers to book tickets. The system is fully functional and was developed using a variety of
            programming techniques and concepts.
